## Question 3: Notes on the Following Topics

### 1. Child Process - `fork()`

* `fork()` is a system call that creates a new process (called the child) from the calling process (called the parent).
* The child process is an exact copy of the parent but has a different process ID.
* The return value of `fork()` helps distinguish between the parent and child:

  * Returns 0 in the child process.
  * Returns the child’s PID in the parent process.
  * Returns -1 if the fork fails.

### 2. Handling Common Signals

* Signals are a form of inter-process communication used to notify a process that a particular event has occurred.
* Common signals include:

  * `SIGINT`: Interrupt signal (e.g., from Ctrl+C).
  * `SIGTERM`: Request to terminate the process.
  * `SIGKILL`: Forcefully kills a process (cannot be caught or ignored).
  * `SIGSEGV`: Segmentation fault, usually due to invalid memory access.
* Programs can register signal handlers to catch and handle specific signals gracefully.

### 3. Exploring Kernel Crashes

* A kernel crash occurs when code running in kernel mode causes a fatal error, often resulting in a system halt or reboot.
* Common causes include:

  * Dereferencing null or invalid pointers.
  * Stack overflows.
  * Hardware or driver issues.
* Tools and methods used to analyze kernel crashes include:

  * `dmesg` for kernel logs.
  * `journalctl` for persistent logs on systemd systems.
  * `gdb` with kernel debugging symbols to analyze crash dumps.

### 4. Time Complexity

* Time complexity expresses how the runtime of an algorithm scales with the size of the input.
* In the given assignment:

  * Checking whether a number is prime takes O(√n) time.
  * Summing the first N prime numbers roughly takes O(N√n) time.
* Understanding and optimizing time complexity helps in writing efficient programs that make better use of system resources.

### 5. Locking Mechanisms - Mutex and Spinlock

* Locking mechanisms are used to protect shared resources in multithreaded programs and prevent race conditions.

**Mutex (Mutual Exclusion):**

* Allows only one thread to enter a critical section at a time.
* If another thread tries to lock an already locked mutex, it will block until the mutex is available.

**Spinlock:**

* Similar to mutex but instead of blocking, the thread continuously checks (spins) until the lock becomes available.
* Suitable for short critical sections where waiting time is expected to be minimal.
