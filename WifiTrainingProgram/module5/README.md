## Week 5 - Wi-Fi 6, 6E, and 7

### 1. Key Features of Wi-Fi 6, 6E, and 7
- **Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax)**: Improved efficiency, OFDMA, MU-MIMO for uplink and downlink, Target Wake Time (TWT), BSS coloring.
- **Wi-Fi 6E**: Extends Wi-Fi 6 features into the 6 GHz band, offering more bandwidth and less interference.
- **Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be)**: Higher throughput with 320 MHz channels, Multi-Link Operation (MLO), 4K-QAM modulation, ultra-low latency.

### 2. Role of OFDMA in Wi-Fi 6
OFDMA splits the channel into smaller Resource Units (RUs) that can be allocated to different users, allowing multiple devices to communicate simultaneously, reducing latency and improving efficiency in dense environments.

### 3. Benefits of Target Wake Time (TWT)
TWT allows devices to negotiate wake and sleep times, reducing unnecessary listening and transmission, significantly saving battery life in IoT and mobile devices.

### 4. Significance of 6 GHz Band in Wi-Fi 6E
The 6 GHz band offers more contiguous spectrum, larger channel bandwidths (up to 160 MHz or more), reduced interference, and supports higher data rates, leading to faster and more reliable Wi-Fi connections.

### 5. Wi-Fi 6 vs 6E Comparison
- **Range**: Wi-Fi 6 on 2.4 GHz/5 GHz covers larger areas, 6E has slightly reduced range due to higher frequency.
- **Bandwidth**: 6E offers more and wider channels.
- **Interference**: 6E experiences minimal interference, being a new, cleaner band.

### 6. Major Innovations in Wi-Fi 7
- 320 MHz channel support
- 4K-QAM modulation
- Multi-Link Operation (MLO)
- Preamble puncturing to avoid spectrum wastage
- Extremely low latency suitable for AR/VR and high-speed enterprise applications

### 7. Multi-Link Operation (MLO)
MLO enables simultaneous use of multiple frequency bands (2.4GHz, 5GHz, 6GHz), aggregating throughput, reducing latency, and providing redundancy if one link faces interference.

### 8. Purpose of 802.11k and v
- **802.11k**: Helps clients quickly find the best available AP by gathering neighbor reports.
- **802.11v**: Assists network in steering clients to better APs based on conditions, improving load balancing and user experience.

### 9. Fast BSS Transition (802.11r)
802.11r reduces handoff times by allowing clients to pre-authenticate with multiple APs, ensuring smooth transitions especially critical for voice/video over Wi-Fi.

### 10. How 802.11k/v/r Work Together
- **802.11k** optimizes AP discovery.
- **802.11v** optimizes AP selection.
- **802.11r** ensures fast transitions.
Combined, they deliver seamless roaming with minimal disruption, vital in enterprise Wi-Fi networks.
