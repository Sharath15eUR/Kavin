## **8. Difference Between IEEE and WFA**  

- **IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)**  
  - Creates technical **standards** like **802.11** for Wi-Fi.  
  - Ensures compatibility at a technical level.  

- **WFA (Wi-Fi Alliance)**  
  - Certifies devices for **interoperability** (Wi-Fi branding).  
  - Ensures that devices from different manufacturers work together.  

Think of IEEE as defining **how Wi-Fi should work**, while WFA ensures **it works properly** across devices.
