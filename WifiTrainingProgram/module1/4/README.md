## **4. Basic Functionalities of a Wi-Fi Access Point**  

A Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) performs several key functions:  

1. **Converts Wired to Wireless Signals:**  
   - Connects to a wired Ethernet network and transmits Wi-Fi signals.  

2. **SSID Broadcasting:**  
   - Advertises the network name for devices to detect.  

3. **Authentication & Security:**  
   - Implements security protocols like **WPA2, WPA3** for encryption.  

4. **Traffic Management:**  
   - Handles multiple device connections efficiently.  

5. **Signal Optimization:**  
   - Uses beamforming, band steering, and other techniques to enhance performance.  

6. **Network Roaming Support:**  
   - Ensures smooth handoff between APs in an **ESS** network.
