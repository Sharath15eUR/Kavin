## **1. In which OSI Layer does the Wi-Fi standard/protocol fit?**  
Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) operates at two layers of the OSI model:  

1. **Physical Layer (Layer 1):**  
   - Defines the wireless transmission method, including radio frequencies (2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz), modulation schemes (DSSS, OFDM), and data rates.  
   - Responsible for encoding, modulation, and signal propagation over the air.  

2. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2):**  
   - Manages MAC (Media Access Control), addressing, and frame delivery between devices.  
   - Ensures error checking and retransmission of lost packets.  

Wi-Fi does **not** handle routing (Layer 3) functions, which are typically managed by routers using IP protocols.
