## **3. What is BSS and ESS?**  

### **Basic Service Set (BSS)**  
- The smallest Wi-Fi network unit with one Access Point (AP) and connected clients.  
- Each BSS is identified by a **BSSID** (MAC address of the AP).  
- Example: A single home Wi-Fi router with multiple connected devices (laptop, phone, etc.).  

### **Extended Service Set (ESS)**  
- Multiple APs working together to expand coverage under one **SSID**.  
- Devices can roam between APs seamlessly, using **BSS Transition Management**.  
- Example: Campus or office networks with multiple Wi-Fi routers under one network name.
